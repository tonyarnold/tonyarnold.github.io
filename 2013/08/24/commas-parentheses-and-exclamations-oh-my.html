  Commas, parentheses and exclamations — Oh my!

</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>Brent Simmons recently posted a piece titled “<a href="http://inessential.com/2013/08/14/commas_for_developers">Commas for Developers</a>” on his blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have an array of options: semicolons, colons, dashes, and words such as “and” and “but.” You can turn independent clauses into dependent clauses. But you can’t jam two sentences together with a comma.</p>

  <p>When you do, my opinion of and trust in your work goes down.</p>

  <p>This is not, by the way, some prissy thing about proper manners. Fuck that shit. I’m not trying to squash your voice. This is about quality and trust.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry Brent but this just makes me want to write less (and <strong>that</strong> is shit).</p>

<p>By all means encourage people to improve their writing skills, but quality is about so many more things than the writer’s ability to correctly punctuate in your native tongue.</p>

<p>I admire the way that developers like <a href="http://mattgemmell.com">Matt Gemmell</a> have made a concerted effort to improve their writing in public. The thing that appears to have been forgotten here is that it’s a process. Were Matt’s pieces half as good two years ago? I wouldn’t think so — he’s had plenty of practice in that time.</p>

<p>I am sad to see <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2013/08/15/language-skills/">Matt “wholeheartedly” agrees with Brent’s stance</a>. Surely there’s a way to promote the same message in a positive manner?</p>

<p>Here’s my take: <strong>Don’t be afraid to write, even if your ability to do so is out of sync with your ideas and passion — you’ll get better by writing and reading more</strong>. I agree that correct spelling and punctuation is a sign of quality, but it’s hardly the only factor.</p>

<p><em>nb. Please feel free to let me know where I’ve incorrectly punctuated — I paid little attention in my English classes, and I could do with the feedback.</em></p>
