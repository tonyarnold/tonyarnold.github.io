  Life and the art of relaxating

</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>So when last we spoke, I was making noises about private methods in Objective-C - I’ll get back to the regularly scheduled nerdery and instructional coding shortly, but I wanted to post a little bit about things that have happened over the last few months.</p>

<h2 id="health">Health</h2>

<p>For the better part of this year, I’ve been dealing with some completely non-double-rainbow health problems (oh, I went there). It’s not over yet, but I’m on the mend and hopefully this is the end of it for a while. This has taken a large toll on my ability to work on my own apps, while continuing to pay the bills by working on other people’s apps - this is why Hyperspaces 1.1 isn’t out yet. I’m on Doctor’s orders to take it slowly for a while - I spent this morning sitting in the sun for the first time in what seems like years. Why didn’t I make more time for this before? Sunshine most definitely <strong>is</strong> double rainbow!</p>

<p>It’s necessary for me to thank my little family now, with the most awesome photo of Leah and Scout ever:</p>

<h2 id="the-new-car">The New Car</h2>

<p>Excitingly, I recently came into possession of a fairly recent model Mazda 6 which I love to bits. Not because it’s a nice car to drive (it is), or because I think it’s a handsome devil (yes, again) but because for the last 13 years I have struggled with the inability to put anything of real size into my car. The Lancer has been a noble steed, but it was well past time for me to upgrade to a so-called “grown up” car:</p>

<p>It was dutifully christened with a trip to <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/OI1Y">Ikea</a> where Leah and I struggled to fill even the remotest part of the space in the back. Despite the loss of sanity from actually entering Ikea on a weekend, I grinned for most of the trip home, and have washed the new car far too much since we bought it.</p>

<h2 id="web-directions">Web Directions</h2>

<p>Next week, <a href="http://south10.webdirections.org/">Web Directions South 2010</a> is on and I’m going to be there as a free agent for the first time. I’ve armed myself with the essential dump’n’burn personal marketing tool - some very stylish new business cards put together by none other than my own <a href="http://topsie.tumblr.com/">Leah</a>:</p>

<p>I’m super excited to see what Maxine and John have in store for us this year - the calibre of last year’s sessions was impressive, and I met some fantastic people. If you’re going to be there and want to say ‘Hi!’ or have a drink, message me on <a href="http://twitter.com/tonyarnold">the Twitters</a>.</p>
