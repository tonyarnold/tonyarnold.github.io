If you've just finished installing your shiny new copy of [Mac OS X Lion][1], here are a few tips for Apple's replacement for Spaces and Exposé — "[Mission Control][2]". For each of these tips, I'm going to assume you've created at least one new Desktop in Mission Control — if you haven't, do that now.

## Create a new Desktop for an application or window##

1. Activate Mission Control;
2. Click and hold on either an individual window, or an application's icon;
3. Drag the selected item up the top right corner of your display — as you do this, a slightly transparent Desktop will slide out from the right-hand side of the screen with a "+" on it;

4. Drop the selected item onto this new Desktop;
5. Bingo! You have a new Desktop, with your selected items on it — simply click the new Desktop to switch to it.

## Set different desktop images for each Desktop##

1. Switch to the Desktop you want to change the desktop picture on;
2. Launch '**System Preferences.app**';

3. Go to '**Desktop & Screen Saver**';

4. Set your desktop image the same way you always do;
5. Move the '**Desktop & Screen Saver**' window to the next Desktop by dragging it to the edge of your screen and holding it there for a second or two;
6. Change the desktop image on that Desktop;

7. Yell our 'hooray!' a little bit, cause it's pretty cool to have different desktop images on each of your Desktops (*'Hooray' completely optional*).

## Set hotkeys to go directly to each Desktop##

1. Launch '**System Preferences.app**';
    ![style: margin-top:5px;background-image:none;border-width:0px;background-color:transparent;-webkit-box-shadow:none;-mozilla-box-shadow:none;box-shadow:none;; alt: System Preferences application icon in Finder](http://static.tonyarnold.com/sysprefsappicon-1311313183.png)
2. Go to '**Keyboard**';
   ![Keyboard system preferences icon highlighted](http://static.tonyarnold.com/keyboardsysprefs-1311313159.png)
3. Select the '**Keyboard Shortcuts**' tab;
4. From the source list on the left, select '**Mission Control**';
5. The final entries in the list on the right should correspond to your individual Desktops — they will be labelled '*Switch to Desktop 1*', '*Switch to Desktop 2*', etc;

6. Set a keyboard shortcut — *make sure that you enable the shortcut by clicking on the checkbox next to its name*;
7. Party like it's Mac OS X Snow Leopard running Hyperspaces (*Partying not provided in package*)

## Assign an application to a specific Desktop, or all Desktops using the Dock##

1. Right-click on the icon of the application in the Dock you want to move to another Desktop;
2. Select '**Options >> Assign To >> All Desktops**' to show this application on all Desktops (this is useful for applications like the Finder, iChat and Twitter); OR
    Select '**Options >> Assign To >> This Desktop**' to make the application open new windows on the current Desktop, even if you're working on another Desktop;

*Note:* These settings persist through quitting and re-opening an application, so if you ever decide you don't like this setting follow the instructions as above but select '**None**' from the menu.

Like [I've said before, I really like Mission Control](http://thecocoabots.com/blog/post/376/) — it's got the right blend of features and simplicity for the way I work. I've had to modify my work patterns a little, but it feels frictionless next to the old Spaces to me (***hundreds of Hyperspaces users everywhere gasp!***). I'm sure as we all spend more time with Mission Control, more features will come to light -- I'll post them here as I find them.
