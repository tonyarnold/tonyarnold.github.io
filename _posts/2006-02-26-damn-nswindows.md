[Windows of Perception.][1] Amen to that, brother.

Don’t get me started on the weird things Apple are doing to the desktop windows (or as Daniel would call it, the “Damn windows”). Try coding a virtual desktop manager when Apple sets windows at certain NSWindowLevels to be sticky (i.e. seen across all ‘desktops’) as opposed to just setting the bit on the individual window that needed the sticky bit flipped in the first place… finesse always seems to be just one step away where the window manager is concerned (although I’m grateful that Apple do seem to update the undocumented CGS calls that I use with each major system update). I hold very high hopes for 10.5 and future versions of the window manager - maybe I won’t need to continue developing Virtue anymore? (hint hint, Apple).
