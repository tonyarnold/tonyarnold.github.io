Hey all, thought I’d fill you in so you didn’t think Virtue wasn’t going to be updated again. I’ve been taking a short break for a week to clear my head and deal with some real world work (and spend some time with my beautiful girl). I’ll be back on deck and working on Virtue in about 2 more days - oh, and I have my MacBook Pro, so things should be plenty speedy now \*grin\*
