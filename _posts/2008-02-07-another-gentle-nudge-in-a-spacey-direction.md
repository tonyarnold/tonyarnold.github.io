**Click the image above to play**. Closer and closer my eager beta beavers, closer and closer…

At this stage, I need to clear a couple of things up:

*   Hyperspaces will be **priced around $15 USD** when it is released;
*   Hyperspaces **augments Spaces - it doesn’t modify it’s behaviour**. Hyperspaces won’t “fix” how Spaces interacts with windows or applications (at least not in version 1.0);

Still with me after that? Cool - **I’m aiming for a public beta release at the beginning of March**. Leah and I are settling the purchase of our first home next week, otherwise you’d have it sooner!
