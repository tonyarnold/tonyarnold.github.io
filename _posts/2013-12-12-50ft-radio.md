I've been reading [John Carey's Fifty Foot Shadows](http://fiftyfootshadows.net/) for a couple of years now, and in addition to his amazing photography and wallpapers, John posts interesting and new music in the form of "[50ft Radio](http://fiftyfootshadows.net/category/music/)".

If you haven't visited the site before, [Volume 9 has just been posted](http://fiftyfootshadows.net/2013/12/12/50ft-radio-volume-nine/) so you should grab your best set of headphones and have a listen.
