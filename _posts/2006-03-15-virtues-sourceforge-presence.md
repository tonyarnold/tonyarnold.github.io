OK, the “Abandoned Project Takeover” (APT) has been approved at sf.net, and I’m now co-admin of the Virtue Desktops project there with Thomas (playback). I’ve sent an e-mail to Thomas wanting his final blessing to go ahead with the update and takeover, but Mr. Staller has been incommunicado for a while now so I think we’ll just power ahead.

Here’s where I start to need help. Virtue deserves a community - you guys are that community. I don’t have the time to maintain the community and to continue developing Virtue - my full-time job takes up too much of my energy. Wanna help? I want your help.

Here’s what I need: people who are willing to help me update the <http://virtuedesktops.sourceforge.net/> site, help me move the appcast there and begin sifting through the bug reports and feature requests. It’s not glamorous work, but it needs doing.

And before you ask, yes, I do want development help, but I would like to start up the mailing lists again to discuss architecture again first - all of the good OSS projects I know of have strong (dictatorial) leadership - I’m going to follow suit for the moment.

**Update:** After all that effort, Sourceforge’s services were sub-par in certain areas. The [VirtueDesktops project has moved to new hosting at cocoaforge][1], which is graciously [provided by imajes][2].
