I’d like to introduce everyone to the greatest icon to ever grace a screen:

<img src="http://static.tonyarnold.com/hyperspaces_icon-1306152294.png" alt="Hyperspaces Icon" class="center"/>

This gorgeous piece of design was put together by Sebastiaan De With of [Cocoia.com][2] and [IconDesigner.net][3] fame. He was an absolute pleasure to work with, and I’ve heard nothing but praise for him from my peers. He’s also got a blog post up his sleeve about [the process we went through together to end up with what you see above][4].

Oh, and the promo site for Hyperspaces is up: [http://hyperspacesapp.com/][5]
