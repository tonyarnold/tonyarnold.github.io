As [you may have noticed](/about/), I joined the team at Itty Bitty Apps midway through last year. I've spent the last 8 months working with my super-talented colleagues on a [major update to Reveal â€” version 1.5](http://revealapp.com/). It's out today, and a huge amount of love and work has gone into making a tool that I think is better than it's competitors in almost every way. And the best bit? It's a free update for existing Reveal customers!

Bringing Auto Layout constraint inspection, a redesigned and rethought user interface as well as innumerable bug fixes and improvements it's a huge update.

If you're an iOS developer who isn't using Reveal: **you should be**. If you are: update now.
