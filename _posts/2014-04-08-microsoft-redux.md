I don't think it's sour grapes. My experience of dealing with Microsoft last year when I was evaluating Azure was unlike anything I've experienced from Apple in my years of being a registered developer. There were personal calls from Microsoft, an assigned platform expert who actually worked _on_ the Azure platform and tweets and offers of help from the top of the Microsoft development food chain here in Australia. 

In my years of developing for Apple platforms, I could count on one hand the number of times I've had direct communication with an engineer who was actually working on the product I was talking to them about. Most of my contact comes through a small cadre of very proactive Apple engineers on Twitter (of which I'm very appreciative), and usually in response to one of my trademarked "Angry Tony Meltdowns™".

I feel this, too. For a company with as much money, and as many insanely smart people as Apple has, the amount of energy they expend on developer tools, APIs and languages still _seems_ quite low next to Microsoft. Of course, that could just be my perception. 

All that aside, this is a conversation that's played out many times on Twitter in the past and the simple reasoning that emerges is that at present, Apple doesn't appear to place much value in the experience developers have when  dealing with Apple.

I _swear_ it's not sour grapes. Just… spend some of those billions on looking after the tribes of developers that supported you on the way up, OK?
