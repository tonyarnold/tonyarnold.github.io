Well, there’s a lot of fluff going around about [Google Talk][1] - it looks to be just another [Jabber][2] server. You can use it by following the instructions at: [http://www.smashsworld.com/2005/08/im-on-google-talk-right-now.php][3].

Personally, unless there’s something I’m missing, I’m not excited - I have my local copy of jabberd configured on my powerbook with both the MSN and Yahoo! transports, which means I can talk to my MSN buddies (with avatars) via iChat. Now that’s something to get excited about…

Maybe I should post some binaries or a how-to on installing jabber locally and using iChat for MSN and Yahoo! chats?
