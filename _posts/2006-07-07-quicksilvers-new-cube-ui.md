So before I give you the magical magic fairy dust to make your Quicksilver cube interface as pretty as mine, admit the pimping-ness of this new interface. It’s hot. You want it. Nick has done a bloody marvellous job with this (this is coming from the sole user of the “mini” interface - yes, I’ve been told I was possibly the only person using it).

You’ll need the [Cube interface installed first][2].

Now: [Pimp your Quicksilver][3]. Trackback your pimped rides, bitches (my pimpspeak is **not** strong).
