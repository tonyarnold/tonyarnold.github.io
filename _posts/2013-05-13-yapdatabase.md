There's been a bit of a buzz on the intertubes today about [YapDatabase](https://github.com/yaptv/YapDatabase) as a potential competitor to Core Data. While I don't think that's necessarily the case (there aren't modelling tools and migrations at this stage), it looks like an interesting project.

[@k7d pointed out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/k7d/status/333659694969278464) that [Tokyo Kit](https://github.com/cobook/tokyo-kit) is a much faster alternative (which is based on [Tokyo Cabinet](http://fallabs.com/tokyocabinet/) a NoSQL storage engine).

I'm happy to wait another 3 weeks and [see what Apple has been working on](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) this past year.
