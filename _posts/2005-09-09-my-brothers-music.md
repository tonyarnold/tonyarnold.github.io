I should have done this the moment I set up this blog, but I didn’t know my brother, Patrick, had any of his music online. If you like wild acoustic guitar work, random harmonicas and an indie sound, you owe it to yourself to check him (and his band) out.

There’s not a lot up there as yet, but you can find his personal music at [http://www.mp3.com.au/patrickarnold/][4] and music from his band - Inanimate Objects - at [http://www.mp3.com.au/inanimateobjects/][5]. MP3.com.au’s download system is awful, so I’m including two Inanimate Objects songs below - my personal favourite is ‘No Time For Haste’ - Pat wrote that song years ago.

* [Significance - Inanimate Objects][2] (~ 5.7Mb)
* [No Time For Haste - Inanimate Objects][3] (~ 5.8Mb)
