Here’s wishing you all safe and happy holidays, and a bloody marvellous new year!

I’ll be out of contact for the christmas period, then Leah and I leave for Vietnam at the start of January (As the late Big Kev would say – “I’m excited!”), so if you have important, world-saving information to give to me, do it **now**.

Unless I get unexpectedly inspired whilst I’m away, there won’t be any further updates to my software this year, and possibly until February, 2006. Thanks to all the simians using my software for being supportive, and a special thanks to my friends who are helping to mirror the rails installer – it’s appreciated!

#### Till next time - adios, crazy little helper monkeys!
