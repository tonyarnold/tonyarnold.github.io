title: I was on NSBrief!
---

A few weeks back, Saul Mora and I sat down for a (virtual) chat on his podcast, [NSBrief](http://nsbrief.com/). It was supposed to be a conversation about being involved in open source projects, but the conversation ended up veering into matters of life and importance.

I got a wee bit rambl-ey, as some of the topics we were discussing were still pretty raw for me (in particular my health over the last few years), but I enjoyed the conversation so I think [it's worth a listen if you haven't done so already](http://nsbrief.com/111-tony-arnold/)!
