Hyperspaces is feature-complete, I’m just working on the user interface controls to configure the desktop elements you can see in the video. I have a few more bugs to fix, a web site to construct and a tiny bit of documentation to write, and then (finally) I’ll be releasing a public beta. Yes, I know what I said - I’m taking it back. I want Hyperspaces to be as polished as [CoverStream][1], and right now it’s not. But it will be - and it will be soon, but whereas 24 hours ago soon meant “Monday”, now it means “before WWDC08”. Flame on.

Oh, and if I haven’t said it enough alread - **Core Animation is seriously the poo**. If you’re not using it in your apps, you should be. Watch the video and tell me you don’t want implicit animation.
