[Justin Spahr Summers](https://twitter.com/jspahrsummers) from GitHub's Mac team recently gave a talk at [Xamarin's "Evolve 2013"][1] conference:

> #### [GitHub Halp App: Minimizing Platform-specific code with MVVM][2]
> Justin is a Mac Developer at GitHub and has contributed to several open source projects released by GitHub, including ReactiveCocoa, an Objective-C port of Microsoft’s Reactive Extensions for .NET. Justin is also a big proponent of using MVVM, and will use GitHub’s internal helpdesk app, Halp, to illustrate how to maximize code re-use.

I'm always interested in different approaches to simplifying my life as a developer, and the GitHub team keep bringing new &amp; interesting ideas to the community.

I'm keen to try MVVM in my next project.
