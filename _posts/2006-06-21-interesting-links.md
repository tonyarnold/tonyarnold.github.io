Just keeping track of some of the interesting things I’ve found (or other people have sent to me) over the last fortnight:

-   [0xced: Relaunch your Cocoa application by itself][1] – a more Cocoa–like method of re-launching your application.
-   [WindowWarp][2] – window warping using the Core Graphics Server in Mac OS X (as the young people say - “that shit is whack, foo” … or something like that… \*mumble\*)
-   [Fundamental issues with open source software development][3] – interesting article that raises some fairly obvious things that all open source projects could do better at (including my own work).
