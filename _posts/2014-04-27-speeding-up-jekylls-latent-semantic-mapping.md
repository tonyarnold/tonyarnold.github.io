Running Jekyll with Latent Semantic Indexing (or LSI) on a site of only 20-30 pages can take 5-10 minutes on a reasonably powerful Mac. I got tired of having to wait or isolate individual posts to get on with writing, so I took Jekyll's recommendation and tried to install the [GNU Scientific Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) (or GSL).

It was a bit of a disaster. GSL itself installs just fine via [Homebrew][brew], but the `rb-gsl` ruby gem and many of it's dependencies would not compile.

So, doing what I always do, I stayed up far too late and fixed the problems. After properly installing GSL on my MacBook Pro, **building my site went from over 5 minutes for a site with about 100 posts, to under 5 seconds**.


## Prerequisites

 - You're using or want to use Jekyll's LSI and related posts function
 - [Xcode][xcode] (and most likely the command-line tools)
 - [Homebrew][brew]
 - Ruby, RubyGems and Bundler

## Instructions

1. Install GSL via homebrew:

        $ brew install gsl

2. If you don't already have a `Gemfile` for your Jekyll site, create one that looks similar to this:

        source 'https://rubygems.org'

        gem 'jekyll'
        gem 'narray', :git => "https://github.com/tonyarnold/narray"
        gem 'gsl', :git => "https://github.com/tonyarnold/rb-gsl"

    > **Note:** If you already have a Gemfile, the important lines are `narray` and `gsl`. Be sure to include the git repository links, as these contain my fixes to compile on OS X 10.9 "Mavericks".

3. Now use Bundler to install the dependencies on your Mac:

        $ cd {YOUR SITE'S FOLDER}
        $ bundle install

    > **Note:** It's probably worth while looking into a tool like [RVM](http://rvm.io/), [rbenv](http://rbenv.org) or similar that will let you create gemsets so that you don't pollute the system rubygems unnecessarily.

4. Now start up Jekyll and activate LSI (add `--watch` if you want to rebuild on any change to your content):

        $ jekyll serve --lsi

5. Make yourself a coffee with all the extra time you're going to save not sitting around waiting for the LSI indexer to finish!

Et voil√†! Super speedy site rebuilds with more intelligent related posts for each page.
