I dislike switching tracks as much as anyone, but after Steven Frank’s twitter post the other night about Redmine ([http://www.redmine.org/][3]), I needed to try it out. I’ve been a long-time user of Edgewall’s Trac ([http://trac.edgewall.com/][4]) using it in my day job for about 3 years now - and I love it, it’s simple, clean and fast. But it’s a pain in the proverbial to get running due to some oddball dependencies, and it’s really only suited to a single product per-instance.

Redmine runs on a bog-standard [Ruby on Rails][1] install (which my host of choice - [http://dreamhost.com/][5] - supports out of the box) and it appears to be as simple as Trac to use.

So I’ve decided to trial it for [Hyperspaces][2] - once I’ve released the public beta, there will be ties from the app to report issues directly into our [Redmine][3] set-up. If you want to sign-up for an account now and have a look around, feel free - you can find it at [http://issues.thecocoabots.com/][6].
