Hello avid readers!

I’m typing this post from an internet cafe in Zadar, Croatia so please excuse any stray punctuation or misspelling. For my friends and family back home, I can’t seem to login to Gmail here, so don’t expect any messages from me for a bit. You’ll have to keep yourselves happy with my [flickr feed][1] - there are lots of great photos of Leah and myself being completely stressed out and lost in foreign cities!

Oh, and for anyone still reading that’s interested in mac news, let the speculation begin: [http://hyperspacesapp.com/](http://hyperspacesapp.com).
