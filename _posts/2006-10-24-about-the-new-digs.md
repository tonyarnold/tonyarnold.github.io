You might have noticed that my blog looks a little different. Well, I had a little… problem with my old blog - apparently it was using around 40% of the CPU on the 8 CPU shared host it lives on - obviously the hosting company wasn’t real happy about that, so I had to fix the situation quickly.

I’ve been eyeing off [Mephisto][1] for a while now - it seems nice and simple and the project has a good idea of what they are trying to achieve. So what the hell - I’m running this blog off [Mephisto][1] now. There are a few things missing (flickr in the sidebar, XMLRPC), but overall things should look pretty much the same. If you come across something that is broken, please let me know via the contact links to your right there.

More news from the real world soon…
