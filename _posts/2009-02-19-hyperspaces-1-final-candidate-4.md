*Hyperspaces 1.0fc4 has been uploaded - it addresses some pretty serious bugs that slipped through with fc3. I’ll be treating fc3 like the third terminator film now - it never existed, let’s move on an make builds with Christian Bale in them…*

I promise I’ll post something non-Hyperspaces shortly - I’ve been living the renovator’s dream and buying lots of power tools, then proceeding to injure myself (or our house) with them. Surely there’s a few stories in there?

Anyhow - more builds can only be a good thing! [Download a copy of Hyperspaces 1.0fc4 directly][2], or [head over to the Hyperspaces site][3] and have a look at the release notes.

This build has the following fixes:

*   **FIX** Resolved a memory leak when removing rows or columns of spaces.
*   **FIX** Resolved a crash when using background colours with a filter.
*   **FIX** Resolved a crash with tiled desktop pictures.
*   **NEW** Added Growl support - you can change the settings for this directly from the Growl preference pane.
*   **NEW** Images are now cached in a more efficient manner - this should mean lower memory usage for users with more than 3 spaces.
*   **NEW** If you choose to run Hyperspaces as an application with a Dock icon, you can drag and drop images onto the dock icon to change the current space background, or click on the icon to activate Apple’s Spaces overview. There is no preference for setting the Dock icon to display - you’ll need to do this manually.
*   **NEW** Added a new “Spaces Preferences…” menu item that open’s the system preferences for Spaces.
*   **FIX** You can drag images onto the image well within the preferences again.
*   **FIX** The switcher no longer shifts slightly when changing spaces.
*   **FIX** I’m trying out a method to fix the white background problem users with older video cards see. Please let me know if this build fixes the problem for you (you know who you are!).
*   **FIX** General stability and speed fixes.

If you’ve got any issues, sling ‘em up on [GetSatisfaction.com][4].
