First up, I apologise for the delays between updates - this build was near to two months in the making. I’m going to take the easy way out and blame the festive season, although I [could][2] [blame][3] [something][4] [else][5].

The new build is mostly about bug fixes, stability and a lot of testing - you can [download a copy of Hyperspaces 1.0fc2 directly][6], or [head over to the Hyperspaces site][7] and have a look at the release notes.

I’ve got a couple features to implement for version 1.0 that I’m happy to confirm now:

*   The ability to show/hide the Dock icon (and probably allowing you to drop an image on the dock icon to let you switch the desktop background);
*   [Growl][8] support - this was actually in there in preview builds and I took it out because it annoyed me. Apparently some users like to be annoyed :) (this is not a slur on Growl - I use it religiously, but I’m selective about with what);

There’ll probably be others. I’ve spent a lot of time looking at stability issues too, and I’m getting a sinking feeling about some places I’m Core Animation - it’s simply too much for some machines - I won’t be turning it off, because it works great for me - but I may look at providing alternative rendering methods on older hardware.

If you’ve got any issues, I’ve switched over to using [GetSatisfaction.com][9] for my support and communication needs - it’s lovely and simple, and doesn’t require you to think like a developer to let me know you have a problem.
