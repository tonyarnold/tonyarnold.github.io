## Or 'dugg' for the grammatically anal but not particularly fussy amongst you

I was asked about a week ago by [wphj][1] to do an e-mail interview regarding VirtueDesktops. It was a really great experience, and I’m urging you to go have a read of the result: [http://macapper.com/2007/03/17/interview-tony-arnold-of-virtuedesktops/][3].

I really enjoyed the experience, and I hope that you guys enjoy the read. Feel free to [digg it][2] as well.
