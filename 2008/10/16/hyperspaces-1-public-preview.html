  Hyperspaces 1.0 Public Preview

</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p><img src="http://static.tonyarnold.com/hyperspaces-switcher-1306152548.png" alt="Screenshot of Hyperspaces switcher from the beta release" class="center"></p>

<p>About 12 months ago, I had a conversation with a <a href="http://brok3n.org/">friend of mine</a> that convinced me it was time to try my hand at writing a commercial software product. At the time, I had only very recently dropped development of VirtueDesktops and was seriously considering just taking a break from Mac development for a while - thankfully I didn’t, and today I’m releasing the fruits of 12 months of learning and hard work: <a href="http://hyperspacesapp.com/">Hyperspaces 1.0 Public Preview</a>.</p>

<p>So what’s this all about, you ask? Put simply, Hyperspaces works hand-in-hand with Apple’s Spaces to add back a few key features that traditional virtual desktop applications provide, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different desktop backgrounds per-space;</li>
  <li>Coloured tinting of desktop backgrounds per-space;</li>
  <li>Naming of each space;</li>
  <li>Desktop labels that show each space’s name;</li>
  <li>Customisable hotkeys to switch directly to each space;</li>
  <li>and more!</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve got quite a few features on the drawing board including a much more customisable switcher and more customisation options for each space.</p>

<p>I also need to thank quite a few people who’ve been a huge support and invaluable resources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My girl Leah - you can have your boy back for a bit now sweetheart :)</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://macrabbit.com/">Jan Van Boghout</a> for all of the code and advice at every stage of development;</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://seanpatrickobrien.com/">Sean O’Brien</a> for the kickass space selector view in the preferences (and quite a few other groovy graphical doodads!);</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~svoida/">Steve Voida</a> who helped reverse engineer quite a number of new private CGS calls (thanks Steve!);</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://acqualia.com/">Nik Youdale and Zac Cohan from Aqualia</a> for advice and crazy code that I barely understand;</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://br0k3n.org/">Chris Forsythe</a> for the kick in the pants to do this in the first place;</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://cocoia.com/">Sebastiaan De With</a> for the incredible application icon;</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://neilang.com/">Neil Ang</a>, <a href="http://jamespamplin.com/">James Pamplin</a> and <a href="http://deanjrobinson.com/">Dean Robinson</a> - for constantly, consistently pestering me to finish this app - you guys are awesome to work with - roll out, CocoaBots!</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s been a long and rewarding road over the last year, and I wouldn’t trade a minute of it but here’s a couple of things I’ll know not to do next time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Working full-time while trying to get your first product off the ground is really hard - I found taking a break once every few weekends really made a difference;</li>
  <li>Don’t buy a house in the middle of writing your first application (on top of working full time);</li>
  <li>Don’t start renovating a house in the middle of writing your first application (on top of … you get the picture);</li>
  <li>Be ready to drop features for 1.0. The Hyperspaces alphas had some great features that will probably come back in a future release, but they weren’t critical to what I am trying to achieve with Hyperspaces;</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ll post a post-mortem that goes into some detail about the programming challenges I faced in a few days. OK, enough rambling from me - go download the preview and <a href="mailto:tony@tonyarnold.com">let me know what you think</a>!</p>
